                <p><b>I've procrastinated working on my thesis for years</b></p>
                <p>Around 4 years ago, I was about to finish all of my classes. By that time, I should've started working on the final stage of my college life (which is to write the thesis). But in reality, I was blinded by the monies from side jobs/hobbies I've worked on. It was great to earn a lot while doing the things I love. It allowed me to do lots of unthinkable things (by my 17yo self). I was able to pay for my own tuition, get myself and my loved ones a lot of things. And the peak was when I [ommited].</p>
                <p>And so, the so-important thesis project slowly moved to the bottom part of my priority list, and my inability to multitask also didn't help. I still chatted with my advisors about my project work semi-regularly. But because of the other things I had to do, I'd made almost no progress for the next few months, and it eventually stagnated.</p>
                <p>Even at one point, I couldn't even think about it without feeling queasy. It's like my body telling me not to think about the goddang thesis and <i>just</i> do anything as long as it's not the thesis. Which I'd done avoiding for months, years even. I'm fully aware that this was wrong, but I cannot — for the love of God — do anything about it.</p>
                <p>Everyone around me regularly asked about the progress of my thesis work, and all I can gave was some empty excuse. I was so, so tired of this specific question. All the questions that came into my ears slowly ate away my own self-confidence. Like, what's the point of achieving so much when I can't even finish this "easy" assignment? It even opened a pandora's box of self realization of how messed up my way of thinking and how short-sighted I am. No wonder I was [ommited].</p>
                <p>And there goes my 14<sup>th</sup> semester, which should be the last semester before I kicked out from uni. But because of the pandemic, I was blessed with a one semester extension. With that said, the head of my dept firmly stated that this would be our last chance to finish everything, or another option was to resign and continue somewhere else. Of course I chose to fight on, which gave me "the power of <i>kepepet</i>".</p>
                <p>It was hella hard to kickstart the work since I didn't know anything about doing a scientific research, which again took away the willpower to <i>do</i> it on the first place. But eventually I learned to start small, and so I finished the proposal relatively quick and then finally, after countless of stressful days, finished everything I needed to do in mid March.</p>
                <p>Ah, I initially wanted to add at the beginning that I have no excuse for this severe procrastination, but proofreading it made me realize that this wall of words was already opened with an excuse :P So now I'm just going to say I'm sorry 3000 to everyone who had to endure dealing with this POS.</p>
                <p>And finally, I want to give my gratitude especially to my beloved family, Ilkom friends, The Money Spenders Society, Hana, Miyu, Mika, Nara, Hyona, Esmilia, eska, and everyone who directly or indirectly helped me went thru... all of this *points at everything*. I hope with this one job done I can slowly work on other self-improvements stuff, so maybe by then, it's gonna be possible for me to hold my head high again.</p>
                <p>Also big shoutout to Matt Mulholland for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9_ao-yAhhY">this rad motivational song</a>.</p>
